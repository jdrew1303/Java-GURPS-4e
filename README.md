# Java GURPS 4e

Java implementation of GURPS 4th edition rules.

Development in progress.

### About

The Generic Universal RolePlaying System, or GURPS, is a tabletop role-playing game system designed to allow for play in any game setting.

Free (lite) version of 4th edition rules: <a href="#">GURPS - 4th Edition - Lite.pdf</a>

### Information

Rules set is developed within package:
  - \trunk\src\net\mortiy\gurps\rules

Those rules are covered by tests from:
  - \trunk\test\net\mortiy\gurps

Within other packages I'm trying to develop some GUI tools.
