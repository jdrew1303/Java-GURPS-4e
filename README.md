# Java GURPS 4e

Java implementation of GURPS 4th edition rules.

Development in progress.

### Information

Rules set is developed within package:
  - \trunk\src\net\mortiy\gurps\rules

Those rules are covered by tests from:
  - \trunk\test\net\mortiy\gurps

Within other packages I'm trying to develop some GUI tools.
