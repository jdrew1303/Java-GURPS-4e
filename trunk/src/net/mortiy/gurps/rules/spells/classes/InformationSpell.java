 * Information Spell
 * ================================
 * Information spells are cast to gain
 * knowledge. Some require you to touch
 * the subject, while others function at a
 * distance; see Long-Distance Modifiers
 * (box) for range penalties. Spells
 * intended to find things are at -1 per
 * “known” item you choose to ignore in
 * your search. Most Information spells
 * have additional special modifiers, so
 * be sure to read the spell description
 * carefully.
