/**
 * Purify Air | Area
 * This spell removes all impurities
 * from the air in its area of effect. It is
 * often used to neutralize the effects of
 * poisonous gas or vapors. Note that a
 * room full of smoke may safely be purified
 * one section at a time â€“ but truly
 * deadly vapors must all be removed at
 * once, or some may escape.
