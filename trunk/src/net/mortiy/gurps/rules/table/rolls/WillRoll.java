/**
 * Will Roll
 * =========================
 * When you are faced with a stressful
 * situation or a distraction, the GM may
 * require you to roll against your Will to
 * stay focused. On a success, you may
 * act normally. On a failure, you submit
 * to the fear, give in to the pressure, are
 * distracted from your task, etc.
 * The effects of a failed Will roll in a
 * stressful situation are often identical
 * to those of a failed self-control roll for
 * a mental disadvantage. This does not
 * make Will rolls and self-control rolls
 * interchangeable. Which kind of roll
 * you must make depends on the cause
 * of the stress, not on its effects.
