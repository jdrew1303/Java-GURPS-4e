 * Legal Enforcement Powers
 * ================================================
 * You are a law enforcer, with the accompanying powers and
 * restrictions. In some times and places, this amounts to a
 * license to kill. In others, itâ€™s little more than the right to
 * carry a badge and write parking tickets.
 * The point cost depends on the kinds of laws you enforce, the size of
 * your jurisdiction, how answerable you are for your actions, and the degree of
 * respect you must show for the civil rights of others.
 * TODO: Legal Enforcement Powers almost always require an appropriate Duty
