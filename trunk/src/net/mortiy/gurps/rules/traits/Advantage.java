/**
 * An “advantage” is a useful trait that gives you a mental, physical, or social
 “edge” over someone else who otherwise has the same abilities as you. Each advantage
 has a cost in character points. This is fixed for some advantages; others can
 be bought in “levels,” at a cost per level (e.g., Acute Vision costs 2 points/level, so if
 you want Acute Vision 6, you must pay 12 points). Advantages with “Variable” cost
 are more complicated; read the advantage description for details.
